    ## Version
    The current released version of this API is 3.0 while minor updates may be available on PTL environments.

    ## Overview
    Use this API to access or update a patient's [Summary Care Record (SCR)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/summary-care-records-scr) - an electronic record of important patient information, created from GP medical records. SCRs can be seen and used by authorised staff in other areas of the health and care system involved in the patient's direct care.
    
    This API is currently only approved for use in primary care software, specifically GP software. We hope to make it available for secondary care in the future.

    Also use this API to update a patient's SCR Consent Preference on the Spine ACS and to raise electronic Alerts when:
    * a SCR is accessed without the patient's permission
    and/or
    * the equivalent of Self-Claim Legitimate Relationship is created by an individual, who subsequently accesses the patient's SCR
    * send an SCR alert message, on those occasions when an SCR is accessed without the patient's permission e.g., in an emergency or when the equivalent of Self-Claim Legitimate Relationship is created.
    * update a patient's SCR Consent Preference on the Spine ACS

    You can:
    * get a patient's SCR identifier
    * get a patient's SCR
    * upload a patient's SCR
    * send a privacy alert message, if you have to override a patient's dissent to view their SCR 
    * update a patient's SCR Consent Preference on the Spine ACS
    
    A health or care staff providing direct care to patients must be present and authenticated with an [NHS smartcard or a modern alternative](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/nhs-smartcards-for-developers) to use this API.
    
    ## Who can use this API
    This API can only be used where there is a legal basis to do so. Make sure you have a valid use case before you go too far with your development. You must do this before you can go live (see 'Onboarding' below).
    
    This API is initially for use by new market entrant GP IT developers with other use cases to follow later.

    ## Related APIs
    To use this API, you need the patient's NHS number, which can be retrieved by using the following API:
      - [Personal Demographics Service (FHIR) API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/personal-demographics-service-fhir) - use this API to search for patients and retrieve their details.  This API can also be used to update their details in some cases. This is the latest version of the PDS API and is recommended for all new integrators.

    This API has endpoints enabling you to get and set access permissions, the same as the [Access Control Service (ACS) HL7 V3 API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/access-control-service-hl7-v3) which it partly replaces.
    
    ## API status and roadmap
    This API is initially for use by new market entrant GP IT developers with other use cases to follow later.
    
    This API is [in production, beta](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#statuses), meaning:
    
    - the API is available in our sandbox and integration test environments
    - the API is available for production (private beta) use
    - we might make breaking changes, but only if we cannot avoid it, and we'll give advance notice

    ## Technology
    This API is [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/our-api-technologies#basic-rest).

    It conforms to the [FHIR](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/our-api-technologies#fhir) global standard for health care data exchange, specifically to [FHIR R4 (v4.0.1)](https://hl7.org/fhir/r4/), except that it does not support the [capabilities](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/http.html#capabilities) interaction.

    It includes some country-specific FHIR extensions, which are built against [FHIR UK Core](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/fhir-uk-core), specifically [UK.core.r4.v2 2.0.5](https://simplifier.net/packages/uk.core.r4.v2/2.0.5).
    
    The interactions between the SCR FHIR API and Spine have been tested with a wide range of special characters including emojis with appropriate Fitzpatrick modifiers. In accordance with HL7-FHIR specifications, this API operates with UTF-8 encoding.

    ## Network access
    This API is available on the internet and indirectly on the [Health and Social Care Network (HSCN)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/health-and-social-care-network).

    For more details see [Network access for APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/network-access-for-apis).

    ## Security and authorisation
    This API has two authorisation methods. The first is [user-restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#user-restricted-apis), meaning an end user must be present and authenticated to use it.

    The end user must be:
    - a health or care worker providing direct care to patients
    - strongly authenticated, using either an [NHS smartcard or a modern alternative](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/nhs-smartcards-for-developers) available via [CIS2 Authentication](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/care-identity-service/applications-and-services/cis2-authentication)
    - authenticated to assurance level AAL2 or AAL3

    The API uses OAuth 2.0 to authorise the calling system. It supports the following security patterns:
    - [user-restricted RESTful API - CIS2 - combined authentication and authorisation](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/user-restricted-restful-apis-nhs-cis2-combined-authentication-and-authorisation)
    - [user-restricted RESTful API - CIS2 - seperate authentication and authorisation](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/user-restricted-restful-apis-cis2-separate-authentication-and-authorisation)
    
    The second authorisation method is [application-restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#application-restricted-apis), meaning a few specific API calls can be authorised by the application making the requests. This is typically provided so that GPs can perform batch updates of multiple Summary Care Records without having to log in as a specific user.
    
    The following specific endpoint and method combinations can be used with application-restricted authentication, in addition to user-restricted authentication:
    
    - GET DocumentReference
    - GET Bundle
    - POST Bundle
    
    For more details, see the following security pattern:    
    - [application-restricted RESTful APIs - signed with JWT authentication](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/application-restricted-restful-apis-signed-jwt-authentication)

    ## NME testing
    The approach to testing for external developers is as follows.
    
    For sandbox, New Market Entrants (NMEs) should perform Self Testing, followed by Integration Testing which will be available on the Assurance Technical Evidencing. NMEs need to meet these to progress in integration.

    ### Sandbox testing
    Our [sandbox environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#sandbox-testing):
      - is for early developer testing
      - only covers a limited set of scenarios
      - is stateless, so it does not actually persist any updates
      - is open access, so does not allow you to test authorisation

      For more details on sandbox testing, or to try out the sandbox using our \"Try this API\" feature, see the documentation for each endpoint.

    ### Integration testing
    Our [integration test environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing):

    * is for formal integration testing
    * is stateful, so persists updates
    * includes authorisation, with [smartcard](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/nhs-smartcards-for-developers) and non-smartcard options

    It also includes ready-to-use [summary care record test data](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/summary-care-record-fhir/summary-care-record-fhir-api-test-data).

    For more details see [integration testing with our RESTful APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing-with-our-restful-apis).   

    ### Production
    Our [production environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/path-to-live-environments):

    * is for formal use in a live environment
    * is stateful, so persists updates
    * includes authorisation, with [smartcard](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/nhs-smartcards-for-developers)
 
    For more information about our Production Environment, contact the [National Service Desk](ssd.nationalservicedesk@nhs.net)

    ## Onboarding
    You need to get your software approved by us before it can go live with this API. We call this onboarding. The onboarding process can sometimes be quite long, so it's worth planning well ahead.
    
    As part of this process, you need to demonstrate that you can manage risks and that your software conforms technically with the requirements for this API.
    
    Information on this page might impact the design of your software. For details, see [Onboarding support information](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/summary-care-record-fhir/onboarding-support-information).
    
    To understand how our online digital onboarding process works, see [digital onboarding](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/digital-onboarding).

    </div>
    
    ### Troubleshooting
    
    * After setting up your new application through the NHS Developer Portal and connecting it to the Summary Care Record API, you will need to ensure your application has a valid ASID custom attribute. ITOC support services should be able to ensure your ASID values are setup to use the [QUPC_IN190000UK04](https://data.developer.nhs.uk/dms/mim/4.2.00/Domains/PSIS%20Query/Document%20files/PSIS%20Query%20IM.htm#_Toc_Section_6.2) interaction. This interaction is for access to resources on Personal Spine Information Service (PSIS), the former name of Summary Care Record. If this isn't setup, you may encounter 403 Forbidden errors when accessing records. This can be checked by emailing [itoc.supportdesk@nhs.net](mailto:itoc.supportdesk@nhs.net).
    * ITOC should also be able to apply the GP summary v3 message set to the endpoints for you.
    
    ## Errors
    We use standard HTTP status codes to show whether an API request succeeded or not. They are usually in the range:

    * 200 to 299 if it succeeded, including code 202 if it was accepted by an API that needs to wait for further action
    * 400 to 499 if it failed because of a client error by your application
    * 500 to 599 if it failed because of an error on our server
    
    Errors specific to each API are shown in the Endpoints section, under Response. See our [reference guide](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#http-status-codes) for more on errors.
    
    ## Exponential backoff
    In the event of a transitory error:
    
    * 429 - exceeded application rate limit (5 TPS per application)
    * 500 - internal server error
    * 503 - service unavailable
    * 504 - response timed out
    
    The following retries are recommended:
    
    * Attempt 1: 1 minute after first failure
    * Attempt 2: 30 minutes after attempt 1
    * Attempt 3: 60 minutes after attempt 2
    * Attempt 4: 2 hours after attempt 3
    * Attempt 5: 4 hours after attempt 4
    * Attempt 6: 8 hours after attempt 5
    * Attempt 7: 16 hours after attempt 6
    * If attempt 7 fails, then fail permanently.

            Where multiple retries are necessary, adopt an exponential back-off approach.

        Use this endpoint to retrieve UUID of patient's latest record.
        The UUID is required to retrieve the Summary Care Record details using GET /Bundle endpoint
        and to update the details of patient's Summary Care Record using POST /Bundle endpoint.
        
        This endpoint also returns patient's consent status in the securityLabel attribute of a successful API response.

        To get the information you must provide patient's NHS number.
        When no NHS Number is supplied in the patient query parameter, 400 HTTP status is returned.
