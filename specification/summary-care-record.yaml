    ## Overview
    Use this API to access or update a patient's [Summary Care Record (SCR)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/summary-care-records-scr) - an electronic record of important patient information, created from GP medical records. SCRs can be seen and used by authorised staff in other areas of the health and care system involved in the patient's direct care.

    Also use this API to update a patient's consent to share their SCR, and to raise a privacy alert where you have to override a patient's dissent to share their SCR in certain circumstances.

    You can:
    * get a patient's SCR identifier
    * get a patient's SCR
    * upload a patient's SCR
    * send a privacy alert message, if you have to override a patient's dissent to view their SCR 
    * update a patient's consent to share their SCR
    
    ## Who can use this API
    This API can only be used where there is a legal basis to do so. Make sure you have a valid use case before you go too far with your development. You must do this before you can go live (see ‘Onboarding’ below).

    ## Related APIs
    To use this API, you need the patient's NHS number, which can be retrieved by using the following API:
      - [Personal Demographics Service (FHIR) API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/personal-demographics-service-fhir) - use this API to search for patients and retrieve their details.  This API can also be used to update their details in some cases. This is the latest version of the PDS API and is recommended for all new integrators.

    This API has endpoints enabling you to get and set access permissions, the same as the [Access Control Service (ACS) HL7 V3 API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/access-control-service-hl7-v3) which it partly replaces.
    
    ## API status and roadmap
    This API is initially for use by new market entrant GP IT developers with other use cases to follow later.
    
    This API is [in development](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#statuses), meaning:
    - the API is available in our sandbox and integration test environments
    - the API is not yet available for production use
    - we might make breaking changes, but only if we cannot avoid it, and we'll give advance notice

    To see our roadmap, or to suggest, comment or vote on features for this API, see our [interactive product backlog](https://nhs-digital-api-management.featureupvote.com/?order=popular&filter=all&tag=scr-fhir-api&deleted=0#controls).

    If you have any other queries, please [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support).

    ## Technology
    This API is [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/our-api-technologies#basic-rest).

    It conforms to the [FHIR](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/our-api-technologies#fhir) global standard for health care data exchange, specifically to [FHIR R4 (v4.0.1)](https://hl7.org/fhir/r4/), except that it does not support the [capabilities](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/http.html#capabilities) interaction.

    It includes some country-specific FHIR extensions, which are built against [FHIR UK Core](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/fhir-uk-core), specifically [UK.core.r4.v2 2.0.5](https://simplifier.net/packages/uk.core.r4.v2/2.0.5).

    You do not need to know much about FHIR to use this API - FHIR APIs are just RESTful APIs that follow specific rules. In particular:
        - array names are singular, for example `line` not `lines` for address lines
        - data items that are country-specific and thus not included in the FHIR global base resources are usually wrapped in an `extension` object

    ## Network access
    This API is available on the internet and, indirectly, on the [Health and Social Care Network (HSCN)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/health-and-social-care-network). To use this API with [NHS smartcards](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/nhs-smartcards-for-developers) (see below) you do need an HSCN connection, although internet-facing alternatives are available.

    For more details see [Network access for APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/network-access-for-apis).


    ## Security and authorisation
    This API is [user-restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#user-restricted-apis), meaning an end user must be present and authenticated to use it.

    The end user must be:
    - a healthcare professional
    - strongly authenticated, using either an [NHS smartcard or a modern alternative](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/nhs-smartcards-for-developers) available via [NHS Care Identity Service 2 (NHS CIS2)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/nhs-identity)

    The API uses OAuth 2.0 to authorise the calling system. It supports the following security patterns:

    - [user-restricted RESTful API - using NHS CIS2 - combined authentication and authorisation](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/user-restricted-restful-apis-nhs-cis2-combined-authentication-and-authorisation)
    - [user-restricted RESTful API - using NHS CIS2 - separate authentication and authorisation](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/user-restricted-restful-apis-nhs-cis2-separate-authentication-and-authorisation)

    For more details, see [user-restricted APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#user-restricted-apis).


    ## Environments and testing
    | Purpose                                | Base URL                                            |

    | Integration test                       | `https://int.api.service.nhs.uk/summary-care-record/FHIR/R4`    |



    ### Sandbox testing
    Our [sandbox environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#sandbox-testing):
      - is for early developer testing
      - only covers a limited set of scenarios
      - is stateless, so it does not actually persist any updates
      - is open access, so does not allow you to test authorisation

      For more details on sandbox testing, or to try out the sandbox using our \"Try this API\" feature, see the documentation for each endpoint.

    ### Integration testing
    Our [integration test environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing):

    * is for formal integration testing
    * is stateful, so persists updates
    * includes authorisation, with [smartcard](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/nhs-smartcards-for-developers) and non-smartcard options

    It also includes ready-to-use [summary care record test data](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/summary-care-record-fhir/summary-care-record-fhir-api-test-data).

    For more details see [integration testing with our RESTful APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing-with-our-restful-apis).   


    ## Onboarding
    You need to get your software approved by us before it can go live with this API. We call this onboarding. The onboarding process can sometimes be quite long, so it’s worth planning well ahead.

        ## Overview
        Use this endpoint to upload the details of patient's Summary Care Record.

        To execute the upload you must provide patient's NHS number.
        In case of an update, before executing the request, latest UUID must be obtained using GET /DocumentReference endpoint
        and set inside the request body.

        ## Overview
        Use this endpoint to retrieve the details of a patient's most recent Summary Care Record.

        You must specify the NHS number and the UUID of the latest Summary Care Record of this patient. This UUID should be obtained using the GET /DocumentReference endpoint.

        If you specify an out-of-date UUID, this endpoint returns a Bundle with 0 entries.

      description: |
        ## Overview
        Use this endpoint to retrieve UUID of patient's latest record.
        The UUID is required to retrieve the Summary Care Record details using GET /Bundle endpoint
        and to update the details of patient's Summary Care Record using POST /Bundle endpoint.
        
        This endpoint also returns patient’s consent status in the securityLabel attribute of a successful API response.

        To get the information you must provide patient's NHS number.
        When no NHS Number is supplied in the patient query parameter, 400 HTTP status is returned.
